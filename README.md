DiOS
====

A simple OS I'll be working on for the foreseable future when I'm bored.

Progress
--------

- GDT setup
- IDT setup
- ISRS/IRQs setup
- Timer setup
- Basic keyboard setup

Under Construction
------------------

- Memory Management
- Pagination
- Organizing of the file structure that's already a mess somehow

Resources
---------

[OSDev][0] was the starting point of this project, thanks to its very useful 
beginner tutorials. Particularly, OSDev's [Meaty Skeleton][1] was used
as the skeleton in this project.

Then, [Bran's Kernel Development][2] was a great source for setting up the GDT,
IDT and the timer/keyboard. Definitely check it out if you're lost after the 
setting up your kernel.

Finally, [Brokenthorn's OS Development Series][3], alongside OSDev, is being
used to navigate the muddy waters of Memory Management.
